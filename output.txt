Algorithm Analysis Homework 8
May 16 (Due next Tuesday class)
1. To ﬁnd strongly connected components of a directed graph G, Kosaraju’s double DFS al-
gorithm starts a DFS from a vertex in a sink component, and to do so the algorithm ﬁrst
computes ﬁnish times with respect to DFS(GT ).
(a) Can we ﬁnd a vertex in a sink component with DFS(G) instead? For example, for a
DAG, if we perform a DFS, then the vertex with the smallest ﬁnish time is a sink. So, we
could hypothesize that the vertex with the smallest ﬁnish time with respect to DFS(G)
is in a sink component. Verify the hypothesis by performing DFS on the graph in Fig. 7.
(b) Can we ﬁnd a vertex in a source component using a DFS? Recall that the vertex with
the largest ﬁnish time is a source vertex for a DAG. Now, is the vertex with the largest
ﬁnish time in a source component of a directed graph? Verify this by performing DFSs
on the graph in Fig. 7 starting with
(i) vertex a in the source component,
(ii) vertex e in the sink component,
(iii) vertex h in a component that is neither source nor sink.
(c) Explain why Kosaraju’s algorithm ﬁrst computes ﬁnish times with respect to DFS(GT ).
